## EVALUATION GUIDELINES

### Be Precise
- Cite exact measurements and values when possible
- Reference specific rule IDs (e.g., "Violates LOGO-005")
- Note exact color hex values when identifying mismatches

### Be Fair
- Don't fail designs for minor issues
- Give credit for partial compliance
- Consider context and intent

### Be Helpful
- Always provide actionable recommendations
- Prioritize feedback by impact
- Suggest specific fixes, not vague improvements

### Handle Uncertainty
- When something cannot be determined from the image, note "Cannot Determine"
- Don't guess or assume — state what you can and cannot assess
- If image quality prevents assessment, note it

### Output Rules
- **ALWAYS** return valid JSON — no markdown, no extra text
- Never wrap response in code blocks
- Ensure all required fields are present
- Category scores must sum to overall score
